Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of the datasets used it to make predictions on new similar type data, without being explicitly programmed for each task.
Traditional Machine Learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output that can be used to make actionable insights.
Machine learning is used in many different applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, automated task, and so on. Machine learning models are also used to power autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, making them more intelligent and adaptable to changing environments
Here I have build toy game names as **FROZEN LAKE** but the question arises here HOW?. It is possible with the help of reinforcement learning and Q- learning.

**Q-LEARNING**

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn in an environment through trial and error to maximize its rewards. It is a model-free learning algorithm, meaning it does not require prior knowledge about the environment.
The algorithm works by maintaining a table called the Q-table, which stores the quality or expected utility of taking a particular action in a specific state. The Q-table is initially populated randomly, and as the agent interacts with the environment, it updates the table based on the rewards received.

At each state, the agent selects an action to execute based on an exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Initially, the agent explores different actions randomly to gather information about the environment. Over time, it starts exploiting its knowledge by choosing actions that are known to yield higher rewards according to the Q-table.
After executing an action, the agent receives a reward and transitions to a new state. It then updates the Q-table by using the Bellman equation, which combines the immediate reward and the expected rewards from the next state. This update allows the agent to gradually learn the optimal action selection policy.

Q-learning continues iterations of taking actions, updating the Q-table, and exploring/exploiting until it converges to an optimal solution. Once the learning process is completed, the agent can use the learned Q-table to select optimal actions for any state it encounters without further exploration.
Q-learning has been widely used in various applications, including robotic control, game playing, and optimization problems. It provides a powerful framework for learning optimal policies in environments with unknown dynamics and complex state-action spaces.

**ENVIROMENT DETAILS**

This environment is part of the Toy Text environments which contains general information about the environment.Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into any holes by walking over the frozen lake. The player may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake.

**Description**
The game starts with the player at location [0,0] of the frozen lake grid world with the goal located at far extent of the world e.g. [3,3] for the 4x4 environment.
Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations when using a pre-determined map or in random locations when a random map is generated.
The player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole.
The lake is slippery (unless disabled) so the player may move perpendicular to the intended direction sometimes (see is_slippery).
Randomly generated worlds will always have a path to the goal.

**Action Space**
The action shape is (1,) in the range {0, 3} indicating which direction to move the player.

0: Move left

1: Move down

2: Move right

3: Move up

**Observation Space**
The observation is a value representing the playerâ€™s current position as current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).
For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15. The number of possible observations is dependent on the size of the map.
The observation is returned as an int().

**Starting State**
The episode starts with the player in state [0] (location [0, 0]).

**Rewards**
Reward schedule:

Reach goal: +1

Reach hole: 0

Reach frozen: 0

**Episode Termination:**

The player moves into a hole.

The player reaches the goal at max(nrow) * max(ncol) - 1 (location [max(nrow)-1, max(ncol)-1]).

Truncation (when using the time_limit wrapper):

The length of the episode is 100 for 4x4 environment, 200 for FrozenLake8x8-v1 environment
